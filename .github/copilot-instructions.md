Read AI-AGENT.md first. Begin replies with "Hi Rob!". Use `scripts/` for build/run/test. Work in small, test-first increments; discuss before adding dependencies.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for comprehensive development workflow, monorepo patterns, database setup, testing strategies, and deployment procedures.
