# Monorepo Migration Status

**Date:** August 13, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 & 2 Complete - Core Structure Established

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Repository Restructure (Phase 1)
- Successfully moved UserService from root to `services/user-service/`
- Updated all file paths and solution references
- Verified all functionality intact - 125 tests passing
- Service can be built, tested, and run independently
- Created new monorepo directory structure

### ✅ Shared Libraries Foundation (Phase 2)  
- Created `services/shared/` with three empty library projects:
  - `Finman.Shared.Domain` - Common domain models (when needed)
  - `Finman.Shared.Infrastructure` - Common infrastructure (when needed)  
  - `Finman.Shared.Testing` - Test utilities (when needed)
- Libraries remain empty until genuinely needed (avoid speculative code)
- Created shared solution file structure

### ✅ Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Updated to reflect monorepo structure and development workflow
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Added monorepo architecture details and service descriptions
- **AI-AGENT.md**: Updated guidelines for monorepo development patterns
- **VS Code Workspace**: Configured multi-folder workspace for better development experience

```

## Verification

The monorepo migration is successful:

- **UserService Independence**: ✅ Can build, test, run independently
- **All Tests Pass**: ✅ 125 tests across Domain/Application/Infrastructure
- **Documentation Updated**: ✅ All docs reflect new structure  
- **Development Experience**: ✅ VS Code workspace configured for multi-service development

## Next Steps (Future - Not Immediate)

The foundation is solid. Future enhancements can be added incrementally:

1. **Script Orchestration**: Root-level scripts for multi-service operations
2. **Docker Composition**: Multi-service local development setup  
3. **Service Templates**: Template for creating new services
4. **Integration Testing**: Cross-service testing framework
5. **Frontend Integration**: Next.js SPA consuming multiple services

## Key Decisions Made

1. **No Speculative Code**: Shared libraries remain empty until genuinely needed
2. **Service Independence**: Each service maintains full independence
3. **Incremental Approach**: Build complexity only as required
4. **Test-First**: All changes verified with comprehensive test suites
5. **Documentation-First**: All structural changes reflected in documentation

This establishes a solid foundation for future microservices development while maintaining the simplicity and functionality of our current UserService.
