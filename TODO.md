# Introduction

This document outlines the tasks and features to be implemented in the Finman application.
It serves as a roadmap for development, helping to track progress and prioritize work.

Items to be implemented will be listed at the high level only here. More detailed plans and tasks will be documented in separate PLAN-*.md files, stored in the "plans" folder. Each plan file will represent a single Analyse -> Plan -> Execute -> Review cycle.

## High-Level Features

### User Service Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Plan Document**: [PLAN-0001-user-registration](plans/PLAN-0001-user-registration.md)  
**Completed**: August 10, 2025  
**Description**: Comprehensive user registration functionality successfully implemented for the Finman User Service. Full test coverage with 125/125 tests passing, including domain layer, application layer, infrastructure layer with BCrypt password hashing, complete API implementation, and end-to-end integration testing. All deployed and fully functional.

### Monorepo Restructure for Multi-Service Architecture
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅
**Plan Document**: [PLAN-0003-monorepo-restructure](plans/PLAN-0003-monorepo-restructure.md)  
**Started**: August 13, 2025  
**Completed**: August 13, 2025  
**Description**: Successfully restructured single-service repository into monorepo architecture supporting multiple microservices. Moved UserService to `services/user-service/`, created shared libraries foundation, implemented root-level orchestration scripts, and established template service structure. All existing functionality preserved (125 tests passing) while enabling future service expansion and unified frontend integration. Ready for Next.js frontend and additional microservices.

### PostgreSQL Persistence and Testcontainers
**Status**: IN PROGRESS ⚠️ (Phases 1-3 Complete, 5 Remaining)
**Plan Document**: [PLAN-0002-postgres-persistence-and-testcontainers](plans/PLAN-0002-postgres-persistence-and-testcontainers.md)  
**Started**: August 10, 2025  
**Last Updated**: August 15, 2025  

**Completed Phases**:
- ✅ **Phase 1** (Aug 10): Dependencies and local PostgreSQL setup
- ✅ **Phase 2** (Aug 15): Enhanced Application Ports with comprehensive IUserRepository interface  
- ✅ **Phase 3** (Aug 15): Infrastructure persistence layer with EF Core + PostgreSQL

**Description**: Implementing PostgreSQL persistence with EF Core while preserving Hexagonal architecture. Core infrastructure complete with FinmanDbContext, sophisticated value object mappings, EF Core migrations with PostgreSQL citext support, EfUserRepository implementation, and environment-aware DI configuration. All existing functionality preserved with 114/115 tests passing.

**Next Steps**: Phase 4 (Connection strings/auto-migration), Phase 5 (Repository optimization), Phase 6 (Testcontainers integration), Phase 7 (End-to-end wiring), Phase 8 (Dev UX/docs).
