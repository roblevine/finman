## What is Finman?

Finman is a modern financial management platform designed to provide comprehensive investment tracking, portfolio management, and financial reporting capabilities. Built using a microservices architecture within a monorepo structure, it delivers scalable, maintainable financial services with a unified user experience.

### Key Features
- **User Management**: Secure user registration and authentication
- **Investment Tracking**: Real-time investment data and calculations *(planned)*
- **Portfolio Management**: Advanced portfolio analytics and management *(planned)*

### 5. Run Tests
```bash
# Test all services
./scripts/test.sh

# Or test specific service
cd services/user-service
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Architecture Overview

Finman uses a **monorepo microservices architecture** that balances service independence with development efficiency:

```
finman/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-service/              # ‚úÖ User authentication & management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/                    # üìö Shared libraries and utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ template-service/          # üõ†Ô∏è Template for new services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/                      # üöÄ Next.js SPA (planned)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/                # üê≥ Docker & deployment configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                          # üìñ Technical documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                       # ‚ö° Build, test, and run automation
```

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed
- **User Service**: Full user registration and authentication with BCrypt security
- **Monorepo Structure**: Multi-service development environment with orchestration
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Persistent storage with Entity Framework Core
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 114+ tests across all architectural layers
- **Docker Development**: Containerized development and deployment

#### üöß In Progress  
- **Documentation Reorganization**: Streamlining and consolidating project documentation

#### üìã Planned
- **Investment Service**: Real-time investment data and calculations
- **Portfolio Service**: Portfolio management and analytics
- **Reporting Service**: Financial reports and dashboards
- **Frontend Application**: React-based web interface
- **Notification Service**: User notifications and alerts

### Architectural Principles

Each service follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) ensuring:
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic isolated from external dependencies
- **High Testability**: Domain logic can be tested independently  
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap databases, APIs, or external services
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities

*For detailed technical architecture and design patterns, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).*

## Development

### Working with Individual Services

Each service is independently developable:

```bash
cd services/user-service

# Development cycle
./scripts/test.sh              # Run comprehensive test suite
./scripts/build.sh             # Build service and Docker image
./scripts/run.sh --local       # Run locally with hot reload
./scripts/run.sh --docker      # Run in Docker container

# API endpoints available at:
# http://localhost:5001         (local)
# http://localhost:8080         (Docker)
```

### Working with the Full Monorepo

Orchestrate multiple services from the root:

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/test.sh      # Test all services and shared libraries  
./scripts/build.sh     # Build all services and create Docker images
./scripts/run.sh       # Run services with orchestration
./scripts/clean.sh     # Clean all build artifacts
```

### Creating New Services

Use the provided template for consistent service structure:

```bash
# Create new service from template
cp -r services/template-service services/my-new-service
cd services/my-new-service

# Follow template README for customization
```

### Database Development

Finman uses PostgreSQL with Docker for development:

```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up postgres -d

# Connection available at:
# Host: localhost:5432 (from host)
# Host: postgres:5432 (from containers)
# Database: finman
# User: finman / finman_dev_password
```

## API Documentation

### UserService Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/hello` - Service health check with version info
- **GET** `/api/hello/{name}` - Personalized greeting  
- **POST** `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- **GET** `/health` - Health check endpoint

### Interactive API Documentation
- **Development**: [http://localhost:5001/swagger](http://localhost:5001/swagger)
- **OpenAPI Spec**: [http://localhost:5001/swagger/v1/swagger.json](http://localhost:5001/swagger/v1/swagger.json)

## Testing

Comprehensive testing strategy across all architectural layers:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./scripts/test.sh

# Coverage reports generated in:
# services/*/TestResults/**/coverage.cobertura.xml
```

### Test Structure
- **Domain Tests**: Business logic validation (framework-free)
- **Application Tests**: Use case and workflow testing
- **Infrastructure Tests**: API endpoints, database integration, and external services

### Current Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 114+ passing tests
- **Domain Layer**: 48 tests - Core business logic
- **Application Layer**: 10 tests - Use cases and workflows  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: 56+ tests - APIs, persistence, and integrations
