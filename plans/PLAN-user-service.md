# PLAN: User Service Implementation

## Analysis

### Current State
- Finman project with .NET microservices architecture
- Next.js frontend planned
- Container-based deployment
- Empty codebase ready for first microservice implementation

### Requirements
- User registration and authentication system
- Foundation for investment tracking users
- Standard user management functionality
- Scalable microservice architecture

## Plan

### Phase 1: Backend User Service (.NET)

#### 1.1 Project Structure Setup
- Create ASP.NET Core 8 Web API project
- Set up Clean Architecture with:
  - `UserService.API` - Controllers and API layer
  - `UserService.Core` - Domain entities and business logic
  - `UserService.Infrastructure` - Data access and external services
  - `UserService.Tests` - Unit and integration tests

#### 1.2 Database Design
- User entity with core fields:
  - Id, Email, PasswordHash, FirstName, LastName
  - CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsEmailVerified, IsActive
- Implement Entity Framework Core with PostgreSQL
- Database migrations for user schema

#### 1.3 Authentication & Security
- ASP.NET Core Identity integration
- JWT token authentication
- Password hashing with secure algorithms
- Email verification workflow
- Password reset functionality

#### 1.4 API Endpoints
- POST /api/users/register - User registration
- POST /api/users/login - User authentication
- GET /api/users/profile - Get user profile
- PUT /api/users/profile - Update user profile
- POST /api/users/forgot-password - Password reset request
- POST /api/users/reset-password - Password reset confirmation
- POST /api/users/verify-email - Email verification

### Phase 2: Frontend User Interface (Next.js)

#### 2.1 Authentication Pages
- Registration form with validation
- Login form with remember me option
- Password reset request form
- Password reset confirmation form
- Email verification page

#### 2.2 User Management Components
- User profile display and edit components
- Protected route components
- Authentication context and hooks
- Form validation and error handling

#### 2.3 State Management
- User authentication state management
- API integration with React Query/SWR
- Local storage for JWT tokens
- Automatic token refresh handling

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Deployment

#### 3.1 Containerization
- Dockerfile for .NET API service
- Dockerfile for Next.js frontend
- Docker Compose for local development
- PostgreSQL container configuration

#### 3.2 Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets management for database connections
- CORS configuration for frontend integration
- Logging and monitoring setup

#### 3.3 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Frontend component testing with Jest/RTL
- E2E testing with Playwright

### Phase 4: Security & Production Readiness

#### 4.1 Security Hardening
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers configuration

#### 4.2 Monitoring & Logging
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Health checks for service monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting

## Execute

### Implementation Order
1. Backend API service foundation
2. Database schema and Entity Framework setup
3. Authentication and user management endpoints
4. Basic frontend authentication flow
5. User profile management features
6. Containerization and deployment configuration
7. Testing suite implementation
8. Security and monitoring features

### Success Criteria
- Users can register with email verification
- Users can login/logout securely
- Users can manage their profiles
- Service is containerized and deployable
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Security best practices implemented
- Documentation for API and deployment

## Review

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Frontend authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Docker containers build and run correctly
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities scanned and addressed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Future Considerations
- Integration with investment tracking service
- Admin user management features
- OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft)
- Multi-factor authentication
- User preference management
- Audit logging for user actions
