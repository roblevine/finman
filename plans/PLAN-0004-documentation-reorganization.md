# PLAN-0004: Documentation Reorganization

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Started:** August 16, 2025  
**Completed:** August 16, 2025

## Overview

Reorganize and consolidate the project documentation to provide a clear, hierarchical structure that serves both human developers and AI agents effectively. The documentation is currently scattered across multiple files with overlapping content and unclear navigation paths. This plan will establish a clear documentation graph starting from AI-AGENT.md (for AI agents) and README.md (for humans), with appropriate cross-references and consolidated content.

### Scope
- **In Scope**: 
  - Restructure README.md as the primary human-facing documentation
  - Update AI-AGENT.md to be the primary AI agent entry point
  - Consolidate overlapping content from MONOREPO-STATUS.md and POSTGRESQL-*.md files
  - Create clear documentation hierarchy and navigation
  - Remove redundant documentation files
  
- **Out of Scope**: 
  - Changes to code or functionality
  - Changes to implementation plans (PLAN-*.md files)
  - Changes to TODO.md structure

## Requirements

1. **Clear Entry Points**: Distinct starting points for humans (README.md) and AI agents (AI-AGENT.md)
2. **No Duplication**: Each piece of information should exist in one canonical location
3. **Easy Navigation**: Clear references and links between related documentation
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All essential information must be preserved
5. **Maintainability**: Structure should be easy to update as the project evolves

## Architecture and Design

### Documentation Hierarchy

```
Entry Points:
├── README.md (Humans)          - Project overview, quick start, architecture summary
├── AI-AGENT.md (AI Agents)      - AI-specific guidelines, references to other docs

Core Documentation:
├── ARCHITECTURE.md              - Detailed technical architecture
├── TODO.md                      - Current work status and roadmap
├── DEVELOPMENT.md (new)         - Consolidated development guide

Supporting Documentation:
├── docs/
│   └── database/
│       └── POSTGRESQL.md       - Consolidated PostgreSQL documentation
└── plans/
    └── PLAN-*.md               - Implementation plans and ADRs
```

### Content Organization

**README.md** (Human Entry Point):
- Project overview and vision
- Quick start guide
- High-level architecture (brief, link to ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Development workflow (brief, link to DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Current status and roadmap (link to TODO.md)
- Contributing guidelines

**AI-AGENT.md** (AI Agent Entry Point):
- AI-specific working instructions
- Reference to documentation structure
- Development methodology
- Code generation guidelines
- Testing requirements

**DEVELOPMENT.md** (New - Consolidated Development Guide):
- Monorepo structure details
- Service development workflow
- Script usage guide
- Database setup and management
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

**docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md** (Consolidated from POSTGRESQL-*.md):
- PostgreSQL setup instructions
- Connection configurations
- Migration management
- Current implementation status
- Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Content Analysis and Planning
- [x] Review all existing documentation files
- [ ] Map content overlap and redundancies
- [ ] Identify content to consolidate
- [ ] Plan new structure and content distribution

### Phase 2: Create New Documentation Files
- [ ] Create DEVELOPMENT.md with consolidated development content
- [ ] Create docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md with consolidated database content
- [ ] Update file references in all documentation

### Phase 3: Restructure Core Documentation
- [ ] Rewrite README.md as comprehensive human entry point
- [ ] Update AI-AGENT.md to focus on AI-specific guidelines
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md to remove redundant content
- [ ] Ensure TODO.md references are updated

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Validation
- [ ] Remove docs/MONOREPO-STATUS.md (content moved to DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [ ] Remove docs/POSTGRESQL-SETUP.md (content moved to docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md)
- [ ] Remove docs/POSTGRESQL-PROGRESS.md (content moved to docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md)
- [ ] Verify all cross-references work
- [ ] Ensure no information was lost

## Success Criteria and Tests

### Success Criteria
1. **Clear Navigation**: A developer can find any information within 2 clicks from README.md
2. **No Duplication**: Each piece of information exists in exactly one location
3. **Complete Coverage**: All original information is preserved and accessible
4. **AI Compatibility**: AI agents can navigate documentation starting from AI-AGENT.md
5. **Maintainable Structure**: New features/services can be documented without restructuring

### Validation Tests
1. Verify all internal links work correctly
2. Ensure no orphaned documentation exists
3. Confirm all scripts and commands referenced are accurate
4. Test that both human and AI workflows are clearly documented
5. Validate that setup instructions work for new developers

## Working Area Scratchpad

### Content Mapping
- MONOREPO-STATUS.md → DEVELOPMENT.md (monorepo structure section)
- POSTGRESQL-SETUP.md → docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md (setup section)
- POSTGRESQL-PROGRESS.md → docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md (status section) + TODO.md reference
- README.md current content → Needs major restructure
- ARCHITECTURE.md → Keep mostly as-is, remove redundant monorepo details

### Key Information to Preserve
- Monorepo migration success story
- PostgreSQL implementation phases and progress
- Script usage patterns
- Service independence principles
- Development workflow (Analyse → Plan → Execute → Review)

### Documentation Principles
- Start broad, drill down to details
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Provide examples where helpful
- Link rather than duplicate
- Keep technical details in appropriate depth-level docs

## Completion Summary

### ✅ All Phases Completed Successfully

#### Phase 1: Content Analysis and Planning ✅
- Reviewed all existing documentation files
- Mapped content overlap and redundancies  
- Identified content consolidation opportunities

  - `docs/POSTGRESQL-SETUP.md` (content moved to docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md)
  - `docs/POSTGRESQL-PROGRESS.md` (content moved to docs/database/POSTGRESQL.md)
- Updated all cross-references and links
- Verified no information loss during consolidation
