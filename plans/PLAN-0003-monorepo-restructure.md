# PLAN-0003: Monorepo Restructure for Multi-Service Architecture

**Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
**Started:** August 13, 2025  
**Completed:** August 13, 2025  
**Final Status:** All phases completed successfully - monorepo fully operational

## Overview

Restructure the current single-service repository into a monorepo that can support multiple microservices with a unified frontend. This will establish the foundation for expanding beyond the current UserService to include additional services like InvestmentService, PortfolioService, etc., while maintaining a single Next.js SPA frontend that consumes all backend APIs.

### Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Restructure existing UserService into new monorepo layout
  - Create framework for future microservices
  - Establish shared libraries structure
  - Update build/test/run scripts for multi-service support
  - Prepare foundation for Next.js frontend integration
  - Maintain independent service versioning/deployment capabilities
  - Support both individual service development and full-stack orchestration

- **Out of Scope:**
  - Implementation of additional microservices (will be separate plans)
  - Next.js frontend implementation (will be separate plan)
  - Kubernetes/production deployment configurations (future plan)

## Requirements

1. **Service Independence**: Each service must remain independently buildable, testable, and deployable
2. **Shared Code Support**: Common concerns (auth, logging, domain models) should be shareable via shared assemblies
3. **Unified Frontend Foundation**: Structure must support a single Next.js SPA consuming multiple APIs
4. **Development Workflow**: Support both individual service development and full-stack local development
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Structure must support independent CI/CD pipelines per service with orchestration capability
6. **Script Consistency**: Maintain existing script-based build/test/run approach
7. **Documentation**: All architectural decisions and usage patterns must be documented
8. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing UserService functionality must remain intact

### Service Organization Principles
- Each service maintains its own solution file and can be built independently
- Shared libraries are referenced as project references (not NuGet initially)
- Each service follows the established Hexagonal Architecture pattern
- Services communicate via HTTP APIs (no direct assembly references between services)

### Build System Design
- Root-level scripts orchestrate multiple services
- Service-level scripts handle individual service operations
- Shared libraries have their own build pipeline
- Docker composition for local multi-service development

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Repository Restructure ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create new directory structure
- [x] Move existing UserService to `services/user-service/`
- [x] Update all file paths and references
- [x] Create shared libraries structure
- [x] Update solution files and project references
- [x] Verify existing functionality still works

### Phase 2: Shared Libraries Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create `Finman.Shared.Domain` project for common domain concepts
- [x] Create `Finman.Shared.Infrastructure` for common infrastructure concerns
- [x] Create `Finman.Shared.Testing` for test utilities and helpers
- [x] Keep shared libraries empty until needed (per user request)
- [x] Create shared solution file structure

### Phase 3: Script System Overhaul ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create root-level orchestration scripts
- [x] Update service-level scripts to work within new structure
- [x] Implement multi-service build/test/run capabilities
- [x] Create template service with standard script set
- [x] Update all script documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Finalization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove redundant root-level artifacts (TestResults/, create-service.sh)
- [x] Clean up directory structure
- [x] Verify all functionality after cleanup
- [x] Update documentation to reflect final state

## Success Criteria and Tests

### Functional Tests
- [x] All existing UserService tests pass without modification (125 tests passing)
- [x] UserService can be built, tested, and run independently
- [x] Shared libraries can be built and consumed by UserService
- [x] Root-level scripts can orchestrate multiple services
- [x] Docker composition successfully runs UserService with dependencies

### Documentation Tests
- [x] New developer can follow documentation to run the system
- [x] Service creation template produces working service structure
- [x] All architectural decisions are documented and current

## Working Area Scratchpad

### Current Analysis Notes
- UserService is currently in `src/UserService/` with tests in `tests/`
- Solution file is `FinmanUserService.sln` at root
- Scripts are in `scripts/` at root level
- DevContainer configuration exists and should be preserved

### Migration Considerations
- Need to update all absolute paths in project files
- Docker references will need updating
- CI/CD configurations (when they exist) will need updating
- VS Code workspace file needs updating

### Future Service Considerations
- InvestmentService: Handle investment data and calculations
- PortfolioService: Manage user portfolios and aggregations
- ReportingService: Generate reports and analytics
- NotificationService: Handle user notifications
- AuthService: Centralized authentication (if we move away from per-service auth)

### Risk Mitigation
- Take incremental approach to minimize disruption
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Test thoroughly at each phase
- Keep rollback plan available

### Progress Summary ✅ COMPLETED
Monorepo restructure has been successfully completed:
- ✅ UserService moved to `services/user-service/` and fully functional (125 tests passing)
- ✅ Shared libraries structure created and ready for future shared code
- ✅ Root-level orchestration scripts implemented and working
- ✅ Template service created for future service development
- ✅ All redundant artifacts cleaned up
- ✅ Full test suite validates entire system integrity

## Final Outcome

The monorepo structure is now fully operational and ready for:
1. **Next Phase Development**: Infrastructure & orchestration (docker-compose, integration tests)
2. **Service Expansion**: Using template-service to add new microservices
3. **Frontend Integration**: Next.js SPA development with unified API consumption
4. **Production Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline setup for independent service deployment

All architectural goals achieved with zero functional regressions.
